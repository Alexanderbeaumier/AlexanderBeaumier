                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Alexander Beaumier, a Cloud Engineer with extensive experience in designing, deploying, and managing secure AWS cloud infrastructures. My expertise lies in automating deployments, provisioning cloud resources, and optimizing system performance using industry-leading technologies like AWS, Docker, and Terraform. I am passionate about implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to build scalable, cost-effective cloud solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My professional journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Urban Planning, where I developed a strong analytical and problem-solving foundation. Transitioning into cloud engineering, I honed my skills in managing cloud environments, optimizing databases such as Amazon RDS and DynamoDB, and ensuring the highest standards of security through IAM policies and compliance protocols. I have since been focused on DevOps automation, cloud security, and high-performance infrastructure design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, furthering my expertise in cloud security, threat mitigation, and regulatory compliance. Through advanced certifications, such as AWS Cloud Practitioner and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (in progress), I’m continuously expanding my knowledge in cutting-edge technologies like AI services (AWS Textract, SageMaker) and cloud architecture.
                </p>
                <h4>Outside of Work</h4>
                <p>
                    When I’m not working with cloud technologies, I stay active by playing basketball, exploring new tech trends, and investing in stocks and real estate. Traveling is one of my greatest passions, as it allows me to experience different cultures and broaden my perspectives. I’m also committed to giving back to the tech community by mentoring aspiring technologists, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. I take pride in helping others grow and thrive in their tech careers, encouraging continuous learning and skill development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to inspire and empower others to succeed, whether through building innovative cloud solutions or mentoring the next generation of tech professionals.
